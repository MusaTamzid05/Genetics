All the programing login in the repo are from the book "The Nature of Code" by awesome Mr.Danial Shiffman.The original book is wriiten with 
Processing language in mind and so this is the javscript version of the original(some chapters).Although this is pretty much the same 
as the original because i am using p5.js which practically converts javascript to proccessing(Thank you Ms. Lauren McCarthy).
The whole idea of this repo is to save this code so that i dont lose it and use it in the future.

The book can be read online(Thank you Mr.Danial Shiffman) => http://natureofcode.com/
p5.js = https://p5js.org/
